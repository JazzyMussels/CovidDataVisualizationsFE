# NYC Covid-19 Data Visualizations

This is a ReactJS application that provides data visualizations related to Covid 19 results in
New York City. The data was obtained from the New York City [Health Department](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data).
As a user, you can view results across all boroughs, see timelines of tests, cases, hospitilizations, and deaths.
The data can also be broken down across various demographics, including race, sex, age, and poverty levels.
In addition, the data can be seen among the different boroughs according to similar demographic breakdowns.
